# Adafruit Feather M4 CAN Setup

Please follow the Farm-ng Amiga documentation about using the micro-controller and uploading script to it: https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/mcu_kit/



Upload the `code.py` to your Feather M4 CAN micro controller.



The script expects newline-terminated serial velocity commands from the ROS-side bridge:

```text
linear_velocity,angular_velocity
```

Example:

```text
0.500000,0.100000
```

The Feather sends `AmigaRpdo1` CAN commands at 20 Hz. If no valid serial command is received for `0.75` seconds, the Feather-side watchdog sets speed and angular rate to zero. This is separate from the ROS-side watchdog in `amiga_serial_bridge.py`.

Malformed, non-finite, or out-of-range commands immediately set both command values to zero. The safety limits are `2.0 m/s` linear and `1.5 rad/s` angular by default.

Compact status feedback is disabled by default because the ROS bridge does not use it, and an unconsumed USB transmit buffer must never block the Feather watchdog. Set `ENABLE_SERIAL_FEEDBACK = True` in `code.py` only for a supervised diagnostic session. Its format is:

```text
amiga_state,measured_speed,measured_angular_rate
```
